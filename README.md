#2D-Array Mapping 
The Code File is basically written in C++ and consists of code to map the content of 2D array into 1D array.

#What is a 2D Array
Two dimensional array is an array within an array. It is an array of arrays. In this type of array the position of an data element is referred by two indices instead of one.

#Difference B/W Array and Matrix
Arrays have only one dimension, a row of elements while a matrix has more dimensions, mostly 2 but can have more than that, and its elements are either column or row arrays which are here called vectors for a matrix with two dimensions or matrices with dimension n-1 for a matrix of n dimensions.
